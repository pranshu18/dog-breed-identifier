# Dog Breed Identifier
The notebook details the process of development of a CNN based classifier using Python and PyTorch that identifies the breed of a dog from a given picture.

The notebook contains descriptions above each cell of what action is being performed by that cell. Corresponding final outputs that were produced by each cell are also visible.

I experimented with 4 different architectures. These are LeNet, ResNet18, DenseNet161, and EfficientNetB7. Through the results, it is demonstrated why transfer learning is needed and I achieved a best accuracy of 80.08% with EfficientNet and transfer learning.
